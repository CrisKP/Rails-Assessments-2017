# Code Review

### This week's assessment will be a Ruby on Rails code review. Create this rails project and upload it to github, and I will go through the code and send you back a message with a code review.

## The Project

We are building a collections manager web app. Start a new rails project with two models: A collection model and an item model. There will be a relationship between these two models -- collections have many items, items belong to a collection.

Choose something that you collect (music, photos, rocks, books, friends ... etc) could be anything. When you go to your web app in the browser, you should be able to create a new collection, add items to that collection, and view the collection with all of its items. Try to style one of these pages to look like a real website you might visit. 

** Notice that I have not created any user stories or a step by step break down of how to do this project. This is an opportunity to experiment with the user stories we have in class and find a way to organize your code progress in a way that works for you.
